# Algorithms: An Introduction 


In its most basic defintion an algorithm is a set of rules or instructions. Think of a flow chart. That's an algorithm. A cooking reciepe is an algorithm. There are many types of algorithms. 

This repo contains code for some of the more basic and simple algorithms. 

# Bubble Sort 

Bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

# Selection Sort

Selection sorts arranges an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and moving it to the index 0 position. It is considered a slow sorting algorithm because of its use of nested loops
